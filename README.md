# GameDev

Repository to store projects developed during DIO.me Unity 3D Game Developer Training.


## Basic Scene and Basic Script

These are projects that I used to start my familiarization with Unity, in which I created the first scenes, using both primitive objects and assets downloaded from the Unity store, in addition to developing the first scripts and understanding a little more about how physics can be applied to objects in scene.
## Bucket Game

It was the first game I developed in the Unity engine, in which the player controls a bucket and must collect the balls that fall and collide with obstacles. The game has a scoring system (displayed on the console) and also a game over, which happens when a count of 5 balls collides with the floor

### Funcionalidades

- Move character (keyboard arrows left and right)
- Basic physics
- Score (displayed on console)
- GameOver (displayed on console)

### Funcionalidades

- Move character (press space)
- Character animations using assets from Unity Store
